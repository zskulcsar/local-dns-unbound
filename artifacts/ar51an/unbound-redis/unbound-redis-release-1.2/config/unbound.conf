# Configure unbound as recursive DNS resolver
server:
	# |Interface & port|
	interface: 10.1.1.2
	port: 53
	# Allows to bind to interface IP before network is online at boot or network is
	# down. Other solution is use 'interface: 0.0.0.0' to listen on all interfaces.
	ip-freebind: yes

	# |Protocols|
	do-ip4: yes
	do-ip6: yes
	do-udp: yes
	do-tcp: yes
	# Set this to yes to prefer ipv6 upstream servers over ipv4
	prefer-ip6: no

	# |Root|
	# Configures unbound to perform DNSSEC validation using root trust anchor.
	# Unbound user must have write permission to file & dir
	auto-trust-anchor-file: "/var/lib/unbound/root.key"
	# DNS root servers file. Updated monthly via systemd timer
	root-hints: "/var/lib/unbound/root.hints"

	# |Process|
	# Do not daemonize, to allow proper systemd service control and status
	do-daemonize: no
	# Set num-threads equal to num of CPU cores. Use 1 to disable threading
	num-threads: 4
	# Faster UDP with multithreading
	so-reuseport: yes

	# |Buffers|
	# EDNS reassembly buffer to advertise to UDP peers (the actual buffer
	# is set with msg-buffer-size)
	edns-buffer-size: 1232
	# Increase incoming and outgoing query buffer size to cover traffic peaks
	so-rcvbuf: 4m
	so-sndbuf: 4m

	# |Cache|
	# Slabs reduce lock contention by threads. Set to power of 2, close to num-threads
	msg-cache-slabs: 8
	rrset-cache-slabs: 8
	infra-cache-slabs: 8
	key-cache-slabs: 8
	# rrset-cache-size should be twice of msg-cache-size
	msg-cache-size: 64m
	rrset-cache-size: 128m
	# Time to live minimum for messages in cache. More than an hour could easily
	# give trouble due to stale data. Default is 0
	cache-min-ttl: 0
	cache-max-ttl: 86400
	# Number of bytes size of the aggressive negative cache
	neg-cache-size: 4m
	# Perform prefetching of almost expired message cache entrie
	prefetch: yes
	# Fetch the DNSKEYs earlier in the validation process, when a DS record is
	# encountered. This lowers the latency of requests at the expense of little
	# more CPU usage.
	prefetch-key: yes
	# Have unbound attempt to serve old responses from cache with a TTL of 0 in
	# the response without waiting for the actual resolution to finish. The
	# actual resolution answer ends up in the cache later on. 
	serve-expired: yes
	# TTL value to use when replying with expired data. If serve-expired-client-timeout
	# is used then recommended to use 30. Default is 30
	# Added for cachedb warning at unbound start. Unbound sets it to 0 for records
	# originating from cachedb
	serve-expired-reply-ttl: 0

	# |Hardening|
	# Trust glue only if it is within the servers authority
	harden-glue: yes
	# Ignore very large queries.
	harden-large-queries: yes
	# Require DNSSEC data for trust-anchored zones, if such data is absent, the zone becomes bogus
	# To disable DNSSEC, set harden-dnssec stripped: no
	harden-dnssec-stripped: yes
	# Harden against algorithm downgrade when multiple algorithms are advertised in the DS record
	harden-algo-downgrade: yes
	# Ignore very small EDNS buffer sizes from queries.

	# |Logging|
	# Verbosity: Default is 1
	# 0 No verbosity, only errors

	# 4 Algorithm level information
	# 5 Client identification for cache misses

	# |Privacy|
	# Deny queries of type ANY with an empty response
	deny-any: yes
	# Set the total number of unwanted replies to keep track of in every thread.
	# If it reaches the threshold, warning is printed and a defensive action is
	# taken, cache is cleared to flush away any poison
	# Suggested value is 10000000, default is 0 (turned off)
	unwanted-reply-threshold: 10000
	# Rotates RRSet order in response (the pseudo-random number is taken from

	rrset-roundrobin: yes
	# Send minimum amount of information to upstream servers to enhance privacy
	qname-minimisation: yes
	# Do no insert authority/additional sections into response messages when
	# those sections are not required. This reduces response size significantly
	# and may avoid TCP fallback for some responses. It may speedup slightly.

	# server. By default everything is refused, except for localhost
	access-control: 127.0.0.0/8 allow
	access-control: 10.1.1.0/24 allow
	# Enforce privacy of these addresses. Strips them away from answers.
	# It may cause DNSSEC validation to additionally mark it as bogus.
	# Protects against DNS Rebinding
	private-address: 10.1.1.0/24

	# |Block|
	# Define tags that can be used with local-zone and access-control
	#define-tag: "school"

	# element use localzones that are tagged with one of these tags
	#access-control-tag: 10.1.1.30 "school"
	#access-control-tag: 10.1.1.32 "school"
	# Configure local-zone for filtered block
	#local-zone: "youtube.com" always_null

	#local-zone-tag: youtube.com school
	#local-zone-tag: m.youtube.com school

	# |Modules|
	# List of module names separated by spaces. Order of modules is critical,
	# order decides the order of processing. Default is "validator iterator".
	# Added cachedb, should be just before the iterator.
	module-config: "validator cachedb iterator"

# Cache DB Module Options
cachedb:
	# Backend db name. Default db is in-memory backend named "testframe". Use redis
	backend: redis

	redis-server-port: 6379
	# Period until unbound waits for response from redis sever. Default is 100ms
	redis-timeout: 100
	# Redis record expiration. If yes, unbound sets timeout for redis records so
	# that redis can evict expired keys automatically. If unbound is configured
	# with serve-expired this option internally reverts to no. Default is no

# Remote Control Options
remote-control:
	# Enable remote control. If enabled unbound-control can be used. Default is no
